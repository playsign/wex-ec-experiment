This is a set of experiments and for technical reasons it's a fork of realXtend/WebTundraNetworking repo with other files copied in. 

Original WebTundraNetworking README:

Binary networking protocol (currently with WebSocket) for a Web Tundra client.

Requires the Tundra server to be running WebSocketServerModule, initially 
contributed to open source by AdminoTech.

Both the server code and this client code will be subject to heavy development
and refactoring. All realXtend core developers (as well as others!) are welcome to
contribute.
